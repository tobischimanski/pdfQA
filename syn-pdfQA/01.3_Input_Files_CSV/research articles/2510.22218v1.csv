0,"The Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) \cite{Zeldovich:1967lct, Hawking:1971ei, Carr:1974nx} are interesting in many research fields such as gravity, cosmology and astrophysics. Being generated from overdensed spacetime curvature fluctuations in the very early universe, the PBHs can escape from the constraint of Chandrasekhar limit, and thus have wider mass range than astrophysical black holes with fruitful properties. Not only is it possible for PBHs to act as $100\%$ dark matter, but also they can produce gravitational waves and/or Hawking radiations, which can be used as a probe of the early universe. See \cite{Sasaki:2018dmp, Yuan:2021qgz, Villanueva-Domingo:2021spv, Oncins:2022ydg, Escriva:2022duf, Carr:2025kdk} for recent reviews and references therein.

1,"The latest observations of gravitational waves with the pulsar timing array (PTA) have been released almost simultaneously by NANOGrav 15yr \cite{NANOGrav:2023gor, NANOGrav:2023hvm}, PPTA \cite{Reardon:2023gzh, Zic:2023gta}, EPTA (with InPTA) \cite{EPTA:2023fyk, EPTA:2023gyr} and CPTA \cite{Xu:2023wog}. By observing a group of millisecond pulsars, they presented the signal correlations of Hellings-Downs angular pattern from $2\sigma$ to over $4\sigma$, which indicates the evidence for stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Moreover, a strain spectrum of $A\sim 10^{-15}$ at a reference of $1\text{yr}^{-1}$ (or nHz) has been found. Although sources from a population of supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) are consistent, it shows that more exotic cosmological and astrophysical sources are more favored. As a precise example, the NANOGrav 15yr data prefers a power-law exponent of gravitational wave power spectral density $\gamma=3.2\pm0.6$ \cite{NANOGrav:2023gor, NANOGrav:2023hvm, NANOGrav:2023hfp} while the SMBHB gives rise to a more steep $\gamma=13/3$ \cite{Phinney:2001di}. For this reason, people are considering other mechanisms for this PTA signal, such as environment effects \cite{Ellis:2023dgf}, or other cosmological sources, such as primordial gravitational waves (pGWs) \cite{Grishchuk:1974ny, Starobinsky:1979ty}, scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) \cite{Tomita:1967wkp,Matarrese:1993zf,Matarrese:1997ay, Acquaviva:2002ud, Ananda:2006af, Domenech:2021ztg}, first-order phase transition (FOPT) \cite{Witten:1984rs, Hogan:1986dsh}, topological defects \cite{Vilenkin:1984ib, Burden:1985md, Hindmarsh:1994re} and so on. See \cite{Ellis:2023oxs} for review about these sources.

2,"Among those candidates of PTA sources mentioned above, there is an interesting possibility that it could be gravitational waves induced by scalar primordial perturbations. It has been shown in Ref. \cite{Figueroa:2023zhu} with the model comparison Bayesian analysis that, the SIGW signal provides a better fit to the PTA data than the astrophysical counterpart. Moreover, it also provides a mechanism for PBH formation. But wait. What about the amount of the PBHs if we require the SIGW be suitable to explain the PTA data? In standard cosmology, both PBHs and its accompanying SIGWs are produced by the small-scale perturbations that are generated near the end of inflation. However, in Ref. \cite{Franciolini:2023pbf}, it was claimed that for single-field inflationary scenarios without non-Gaussianity, or even with positive non-Gaussianity, the amount of PBHs will be overproduced (with its fraction $f_{\rm PBH}\geq 1$) when the SIGW spectrum is required to explain the PTA data. The same results are obtained in \cite{Dandoy:2023jot} even for earlier NANOGrav 12.5yr observational data analysis. Such a tension, dubbed as the ``overproduction problem"", will thus place severe constraints on inflationary models which is responsible for PBH production.

3,"The requirement to overcome this issue places constraints on the inflation models, which requires them to possess certain features. Naively speaking, it may be helpful to reduce the population of the formed PBHs with either a large negative non-Gaussianity \cite{Franciolini:2023pbf, Wang:2023ost, Liu:2023ymk, DeLuca:2023tun, Firouzjahi:2023xke, Chang:2023aba, Pi:2024lsu, Inui:2024fgk} or a different window function/threshold value \cite{Inomata:2023zup}, but for better illustration, it is important to have a concrete model, see \cite{Unal:2023srk, Geller:2023shn, HosseiniMansoori:2023mqh, Balaji:2023ehk, Gorji:2023sil, Zhu:2023gmx, Liu:2023pau, Frosina:2023nxu, Bhaumik:2023wmw, Choudhury:2023hfm, Yi:2023npi, Choudhury:2023fwk, Liu:2023hpw, Choudhury:2023fjs, Choudhury:2024one, Wang:2024euw, Domenech:2024rks, Papanikolaou:2024fzf, Choudhury:2024dzw, Choudhury:2024kjj}. In this work, we're particularly interested in the case where the dispersion relation of the inflaton field gets modified, with a correction of $k^4$ term. In some higher derivative theories or modified gravity theories interesting in cosmology, it is natural to modify the dispersion relation, while such a term will appear as a leading order correction \cite{Arkani-Hamed:2003pdi, Arkani-Hamed:2003juy, Qiu:2015aha, Qiu:2018nle}. Moreover, this term could also allow us to get a varying sound speed $c_s$, which is useful to generate PBHs without violating the consistency requirement and leading to strong coupling \cite{Ballesteros:2018wlw, Ballesteros:2021fsp, Gorji:2021isn, Qiu:2022klm}. Note that people have considered a constant $c_s$ different from unity during both inflation \cite{Choudhury:2023fwk,Choudhury:2023fjs} and the radiation-dominant era \cite{Balaji:2023ehk,Liu:2023hpw}. The former will affect the primordial power spectrum generated during inflation, while the latter will affect the transfer function in the calculation of the SIGW. On the other hand, the case where $c_s$ varys during the inflation era is less discussed.

In our case, the region for $f_{\rm nl}$ near $-1$ is kept from being too close to the center of the PDF of $(\zeta_G, {\cal C}_G)$, thus is tend to avoid the PBHs being overproduced. A too high or too low $f_{\rm nl}$ will both push the overthreshold region inward to raise the productivity of the PBHs. Moreover, the area of PDF also changes with the horizon scale $r_H$. When combined with the SIGW results, we can see in Fig. \ref{fig:fPBH} that while $f_{\rm PBH}=1$ line with $f_{\rm nl}\simeq 0$ (no non-Gaussianity) is marginally included into $2\sigma$ region,  the one with $f_{\rm nl}\simeq -1$ is well within the $2\sigma$ level. This means both modified dispersion relation and negative non-Gaussianity are helpful in resolving the overproduction problem (but the later seems to be more significant). This is in agreement with previous results.

106,"Moreover, we also calculate the mass distribution of the PBHs. We find that in the current case, the mostly generated PBHs can reach a sub-solar mass of ${\cal O}(10^{-2})M_\odot$ (shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fPBHofMPBH}), with the maximal value of $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}(M_\mathrm{PBH})$ depending on parameters $A$. For overproduction avoidance $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}(M_\mathrm{PBH})$ could reach up to unity, but it can also be lower in order not to be conflicted with constraints from microlensing. Moreover, these constraints might also be released to contain higher $f_{\rm PBH}$ by PBH clustering, by which the number density of PBHs can get reduced (see e.g. \cite{Hawkins:2015uja, Calcino:2018mwh}).

107,"The overproduction problem is an interesting topic about PBH and SIGW generations. It releases the signal that nowadays observations will impose more and more accurate and stringent constraints on these processes. Such constraints will bring challenges to our theoretical analysis and model constructions. However, since we're not very clear about these processes and there are large uncertainties in calculation methodologies and problems resolutions, they will also deepen our understanding and help us find more optimistic descriptions on them. Therefore, it is interesting to continue discussing about other possibilities on resolving the overproduction problem (as well as other problems), into which we will be devoting ourselves in the future works.

   The Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data of nano-Hertz gravitational waves released in 2023 implies that if such gravitational waves comes from the scalar perturbation induction at the end of inflation, the accompanied primordial black holes (PBHs) will be over-produced, with the fraction exceed the upper bound of unity. This is recognized as the ``overproduction problem"", which calls for nontrivial features in the early universe. In this paper, we try to check out whether a modified dispersion relation (MDR) of the primordial perturbations can be helpful for solving the problem. From the constraint on PTA data, we obtain a posterior distribution of the parameters of primordial perturbation, and find that the MDR model, where the $k^4$ term becomes important at later time, can give rise to a broken-power-law (BPL) power spectrum which can alleviate the overproduction problem to nearly $2\sigma$ level. However, to improve furtherly into $1\sigma$ still needs small negative non-Gaussianity, e.g. $f_{\rm nl}\simeq -1$. The mass distribution of the PBHs generated is also discussed.
