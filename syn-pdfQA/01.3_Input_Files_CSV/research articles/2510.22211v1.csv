0,"The X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a new type of transient phenomenon associated with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their physical origin has sparked intensive debates since their discoveries~\citep{Miniutti2019}. The most remarkable features of QPEs are the extremely high-amplitude bursts of X-ray radiation that recur every few hours to days. The peak luminosity of these bursts can be up to $\sim100$ times higher than that of the quiescent level. Only about 10 galaxies have been observed to show QPEs so far, including GSN~069 \citep{Miniutti2019}, RXJ1301 \citep{Sun2013,Giustini2020}, eRO-QPE1, eRO-QPE2 \citep{Arcodia2021}, eRO-QPE3, eRO-QPE4 \citep{Arcodia2024}, eRO-QPE5 \citep{Arcodia2025}, XMMSL1~J0249 \citep{Chakraborty2021}, AT~2019vcb \citep{Quintin2023}, AT~2019qiz \citep{Nicholl2024}, AT~2022upj \citep{Chakraborty2025} and ZTF19acnskyy \citep[Ansky,][]{J1335+0728,Hernandez-Garcia2025}.
Various models have been proposed to explain QPEs, which can be broadly categorized into two classes. One is the disk instability model~\citep{Raj2021,Pan2022,Kaur2023,Middleton2025} and the other is the interaction model involving a stellar-mass orbiting companion in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) with a SMBH (\citealt{King2020,Xian2021,Wang2022,Zhao2022,Lu2023,Franchini2023,Linial2023b,Tagawa2023,Zhou2024a}).

1,"A major recent breakthrough is the first direct detection of QPEs following a confirmed optical tidal disruption event (TDE, \citealt{Rees1988,Gezari2021}), AT2019qiz~\citep{Nicholl2024}. This discovery provides compelling evidence that at least a subset of QPEs are physically linked to TDEs. Intriguingly, similar connections were previously suggested for the prototypical QPE source GSN069, which displays TDE-like features in its long-term X-ray evolution~\citep{Shu2018} and its abnormal nitrogen-enriched gas~\citep{Sheng2021}, as well as in other systems including AT2019vcb \citep{Quintin2023}, XMMSL1J024916.6-041244~\citep{Chakraborty2021}, and AT2022upj~\citep{Chakraborty2025}. Remarkably, QPE and TDE host galaxies share several distinctive characteristics, including a strong preference for poststarburst galaxies~\citep{Wevers2022} and the frequent presence of extended emission-line regions (EELRs, \citealt{Wevers2024,Wevers2024b}), which are indicative of recently faded active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The mounting evidence for QPE-TDE connections has given rise to the ""EMRI+TDE=QPE"" model~\citep{Linial2023b}, which yet requires EMRIs to reside in unusual quasi-circular orbits~\citep{Zhou2024a,Zhou2024b}, likely formed during previous AGN phases~\citep{Pan2021wetEMRI}. This progress motivates a unified model in which QPEs represent a transient phase following TDEs involving SMBHs shortly after the cessation of AGN activity~\citep{Jiang2025}.  Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether all QPEs originate from this channel, and if not, what fraction do.

2,"Among known QPE sources to date, the one discovered by~\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025} is of particular interest as it may represent the first confirmed case of QPEs arising from the awakening of a dormant SMBH. The galaxy SDSSJ1335+0728, at a redshift of 0.024, had remained photometrically stable for two decades until 2019 December, when an optical brightening (designated ZTF19acnskyy or ""Ansky"") was detected. Subsequent X-ray monitoring beginning in 2024 February revealed extreme QPE activity characterized by a recurrence period of approximately 4.5 days, the highest fluxes and amplitudes, the longest timescales, and the largest integrated energies observed to date. Given that its optical light curve deviates significantly from that of typical optical TDEs, \citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025} proposed that the QPEs in this system are more likely associated with a turn-on AGN rather than a TDE. This discovery, therefore, potentially broadens the range of plausible formation channels for QPEs. However, as discussed by both \citet{J1335+0728} and \citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025}, an exotic TDE scenario for Ansky cannot be definitively ruled out. First, its blue optical color and soft X-ray emission (blackbody temperature $kT_{\rm bb} \approx 50$–100~eV) are both typical characteristics of TDEs. Moreover, the absence of broad emission lines in the optical spectra of SDSSJ1335+0728 even after the outburst \citep{J1335+0728} poses a challenge for the AGN interpretation. In contrast, it aligns more naturally with the TDE scenario, particularly considering the existence of a subclass of featureless TDEs \citep{Hammerstein2023,Yao2025,Anna2025}.

6,"In our HST UV spectroscopic observations, we selected the ACQ/IMAGE acquisition mode with a clear filter. This mode provides an acquisition image covering an area of $100\times100$ pixels. Therefore, we can utilize the high spatial resolution of HST to verify whether the source is located at the center of the host galaxy. Specifically, we used the two-dimensional fitting algorithm {\tt GALFIT}~\citep{Peng2010} to model the image using a two-component fit consisting of a PSF and a Sérsic profile. The cutout images of the observed data, model, and residual are shown in Figure~\ref{HST_image}. We measured an offset of $0.34\pm0.70$ pixels between the barycenter of the PSF and the galaxy center, corresponding to approximately $9\pm18$ pc. This result indicates that the location of the outburst is consistent with the galactic center.

We used the Python package Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE; \citealt{CIGALE}) to model the SED of the host galaxy.

Additionally, there is no contribution of AGN ($f_{\rm AGN}=0$) in our fit and gives an upper limit luminosity of the AGN component of $\rm 6\times10^{41}erg\,s^{-1}$, which is consistent with the conclusion that no AGN variability in the last $\sim$2 decades from \citet{J1335+0728}.

38,"An optically thick reprocessing layer surrounding the inner accretion flow can efficiently thermalize the ionizing radiation, suppressing line formation and producing the nearly blackbody continua observed \citep{Roth2020}. The extreme ionization state of the reprocessing gas may further inhibit bound–bound transitions from H and He, preventing the appearance of broad emission features commonly seen in other TDEs. Such an extreme ionization state can be induced by either a very high irradiating luminosity or a reprocessing envelope with a relatively low column density. Furthermore, any residual line photons generated in the outflow are subject to repeated electron scattering, which erases line contrast, leaving behind a smooth, high-temperature blackbody spectrum with a steep UV slope. Geometric and orientation effects may contribute as well, since the radiation produced from a disk is likely anisotropic, and the emergent optical depth depends on the viewing angle. Taken together, these considerations suggest that featureless TDEs arise from systems with reprocessing layers that are optically and geometrically thick, yet highly ionized, naturally producing spectra that diverge from those of AGNs while remaining consistent with theoretical expectations for TDE emission. Notably, previously identified featureless TDEs generally exhibit high luminosities \citep{Hammerstein2023,Yao2023}, consistent with efficient reprocessing of accretion power into a smooth continuum.

Similar excess variance can be seen in the $r$-band of AT2022gri, while its $g$-band light curve remains relatively smooth.

Therefore, a post-MS TDE can successfully explain Ansky's longer time scale and lower luminosity compared to normal TDEs.

53,"Besides EELRs, \citet{Wu2025} have proposed a novel method to identify recently faded AGN systems through the infrared (IR) echoes of a torus remnant. After the AGN activity turned off, the inner part of the torus disappeared first due to frequent collisions between clumps that rapidly dissipated their orbital energy. When only the outer part of the torus is left behind, an IR dust echo naturally follows a TDE~\citep{Lu2016,Jiang2016,vV2016}, albeit with a long time delay as a result of the large inner radius of the torus. This phenomenon has been firmly observed in AT2019qiz, whose IR echo indicates a torus radius $>1.2$pc. As discussed in \citet{Wu2025}, the IR echo of Ansky also shows an atypically long time delay, supporting the presence of a torus remnant. 
The dust covering factor of Ansky is estimated to be 0.06, following ~\citet{Jiang2021} and using the latest dust luminosity~\citep{Wu2025}. It should be emphasized that this is only a lower limit, since the IR light curve was still rising until the last IR photometry, after which the WISE satellite retired. TDEs in normal galaxies usually have a dust covering factor of $\sim0.01$ or less~\citep{Jiang2021}, so the dust covering factor of Ansky is significantly higher than that of normal TDEs. On the other hand, the residual torus may be collapsing towards the equatorial plane due to the absence of radiation pressure support. Therefore, Ansky's covering factor may represent an intermediate value between AGNs and TDEs.
Moreover, the delayed yet rapid emergence of the \oiii\ emission suggests that the gas is distributed on a parsec scale (see Figure~\ref{cartoon}), which had remained unionized before the occurrence of Ansky due to the faded AGN. However, on larger scales, a residual extended \oiii\ emission region may still be visible. Located at a low redshift of 0.024, Ansky's host galaxy is an ideal target for IFS observation.

X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are rare and enigmatic phenomena that increasingly show a connection to tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, the recently discovered QPEs in ZTF19acnskyy (""Ansky"") appear to be linked to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) rather than a TDE, as their slow decay and AGN-like variability differ markedly from that of typical TDEs. This finding may imply broader formation channels for QPEs. To further investigate Ansky’s nature, we obtained a timely ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which reveals a featureless, TDE-like spectrum devoid of broad optical or UV emission lines. Additionally, the steep UV continuum, fitted by a power-law  with an index of -2.6, aligns more closely with TDEs than with AGNs. Compared to other featureless TDEs, Ansky exhibits a significantly lower blackbody luminosity ($\sim10^{43}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$) and much longer rise/decay timescales, suggesting a distinct TDE subclass. An offset TDE involving an intermediate-mass black hole is unlikely, given its position consistent with the galactic center with a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 54\,pc. Instead, we propose that Ansky may result from the tidal disruption of a post-main-sequence star by a typical supermassive black hole. Our findings strengthen the growing evidence for TDE-QPE associations, although other formation channels for QPEs remain plausible and await future observational efforts.
