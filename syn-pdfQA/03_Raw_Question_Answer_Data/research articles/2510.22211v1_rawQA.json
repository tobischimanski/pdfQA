            "In order to test for any UV line features of Ansky, we performed both blackbody and power-law fits on the HST spectrum. The best-fit blackbody temperature is $\\rm38,063\\pm107\\,K$, and the power-law fitting result is $f_{\\lambda} \\propto \\lambda^{-2.6}$. This slope is much steeper than that of AGNs, which have a typical index of -1.5 \\citep{Vanden2001}, further disfavoring the AGN scenario. We then subtracted the best-fit power-law component, and the residual spectrum is shown in the bottom panel of Figure~\\ref{hst_spec}. We do not detect any emission line features, including typical broad emission lines seen in Type 1 AGNs, in the residual spectrum, although it is noisy at the joint wavelength of G140L and G230L (1500--1600\\,\\AA).

        "question": "What evidence supports the classification of Ansky as a featureless tidal disruption event (TDE) rather than an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or a weak-emission-line quasar (WLQ), and what physical mechanisms are proposed to explain its unusual spectral and photometric properties?",
        "answer": "Several lines of evidence support the classification of Ansky as a featureless TDE rather than an AGN or a WLQ. First, multi-epoch UV and optical spectra of Ansky consistently reveal a featureless continuum best described by a high-temperature blackbody (T_BB ~38,000 K), with no detectable broad emission lines, even years after the outburst. This persistent absence of broad emission lines is difficult to reconcile with a turn-on AGN scenario, where such lines are a defining signature. Furthermore, while WLQs also lack strong broad emission lines, they typically show weak Mg II and H\u03b2 lines and possess hard X-ray spectra, all of which are absent in Ansky. Instead, Ansky's X-ray emission is super-soft and consistent with a blackbody, further distinguishing it from WLQs and AGNs.\n\nPhotometrically, Ansky exhibits a long rising timescale (~128 days) and a very long decline (~1550 days), with a peak blackbody luminosity at the lower end of optical TDEs. Its light curve shows excess variance and a rebrightening feature, which are common among optical TDEs. The UV spectrum of Ansky closely resembles those of other nearby featureless TDEs, such as AT2021ehb and AT2022gri, all characterized by high-temperature blackbody spectra and a lack of broad emission lines, setting them apart from typical AGNs.\n\nThe physical mechanism proposed to explain these properties involves an optically thick, highly ionized reprocessing layer surrounding the inner accretion flow. This layer efficiently thermalizes ionizing radiation, suppressing line formation and producing the observed smooth, high-temperature blackbody continuum. The extreme ionization state inhibits bound\u2013bound transitions, preventing the appearance of broad emission features. Additionally, repeated electron scattering in the outflow erases any residual line contrast. Geometric and orientation effects may also play a role, as the emergent optical depth and observed spectrum can depend on the viewing angle. While most previously identified featureless TDEs are high-luminosity events, the discovery of low-luminosity examples like Ansky suggests that geometry-dependent effects may be important in shaping their observed properties.\n\nIn summary, the combination of spectral, photometric, and X-ray characteristics, along with theoretical models of reprocessing layers, strongly supports the interpretation of Ansky as a featureless TDE rather than an AGN or WLQ.",

            "\\item[$\\bullet$] The timescale of Ansky's light curves is very long. We calculated that the $t_{1/2,\\rm rise}$ is nearly 128 days and the $t_{1/2,\\rm decline}$ is nearly 1550 days. However, Ansky continues to fade, following a slow power-law decline.\n",
            "All of the multi-wavelength characteristics of Ansky are difficult to reconcile with a turn-on AGN scenario. The most challenging feature to explain is the persistent absence of broad emission lines, which is a defining signature of turn-on AGNs~\\citep{Gezari2017,Yan2019}. It is particularly puzzling that no gas appears to be present at the typical broad-line region (BLR) scale, while substantial gas exists both in the inner accretion disk, as evidenced by the outburst continuum, and at larger scales traced by the strong delayed \\oiii\\ emission (Section~\\ref{spec}). This suggests an apparent gas gap precisely at BLR scales (see a cartoon in Figure~\\ref{cartoon}).\n",
            "It is worth noting that there is a rare subclass of AGNs generally found at high redshifts ($z\\gtrsim1.5$), known as weak-emission-line quasars (WLQs; \\citealt{McDowell1995,Fan1999}), which are characterized by the absence of strong broad emission lines in their optical (rest-frame UV) spectra. However, a weak \\mgii$\\lambda$2799  emission line is commonly detectable in WLQs~\\citep{Paul2022} (see an example in Figure~\\ref{spec_compare}), which is still absent in Ansky. In addition, near-infrared (rest-frame optical) spectroscopy of WLQs reveals that their \\hb\\ lines are not significantly weaker than those of typical quasars~\\citep{chen2024}, in contrast to those of Ansky. Furthermore, \\citet{Ni2018} summarized the X-ray properties of 32 WLQs and found that they typically possess a hard power-law effective photon index ($\\rm \\Gamma_{eff} \\sim 1.2$), as measured from the X-ray stacking spectrum of 14 WLQs. Therefore, WLQs are also highly inconsistent with Ansky in terms of their X-ray and rest-frame UV-to-optical spectral properties.\n",
            "In this subsection, we will show that the unusual properties observed in Ansky align naturally with the characteristics of featureless TDEs. These are a new population of optical TDEs that are featured by their blue continuum, yet lack the discernible emission lines or spectroscopic features present in the canonical TDE classes~\\citep{Hammerstein2023}. Featureless TDEs generally have a higher luminosity, a longer rising time scale, and a more massive black hole than other TDEs~(see Figure~\\ref{LCs_compare}). However, Ansky lies at the lower end of luminosity and at the longer end of the rising timescale~\\footnote{Note that the short timescale of TDEs in~\\citet{Yao2023} may be due to selection bias as they selected TDEs with e-folding rise/decline time of 2--300 days.}. Interestingly, we found that AT2022gri --- the other nearby featureless TDE ---  also exhibits a low luminosity and a long rising timescale that differ markedly from those of other featureless TDEs. \n",
            "We also collected all available archival HST UV spectra of featureless TDEs, which we present in Figure~\\ref{spec_compare}.  Notably, the UV spectrum of Ansky closely resembles those of two nearby featureless TDEs: AT2021ehb \\citep{AT2021ehb} and AT2022gri (ID: 17001, PI: Walter Maksym). All three sources display the hallmark of an extremely high-temperature blackbody spectrum, consistent with values derived from optical photometry, and the characteristic of the featureless TDE population \\citep{Hammerstein2023}. In addition, their steep UV spectra, lacking broad emission lines, are markedly different from those typically observed in AGNs, as shown for comparison in Figure~\\ref{spec_compare}. Another \"X-ray long-lived\" TDE, GSN069, displays emission features indicative of TDEs in a very late stage yet lacks classic AGN emissions~\\citep{Shu2018,Miniutti2019,Sheng2021,Guolo2025}. It shares certain similarities with the UV spectra of featureless TDEs, while all four sources clearly deviate from the typical AGNs.\n",
            "An optically thick reprocessing layer surrounding the inner accretion flow can efficiently thermalize the ionizing radiation, suppressing line formation and producing the nearly blackbody continua observed \\citep{Roth2020}. The extreme ionization state of the reprocessing gas may further inhibit bound\u2013bound transitions from H and He, preventing the appearance of broad emission features commonly seen in other TDEs. Such an extreme ionization state can be induced by either a very high irradiating luminosity or a reprocessing envelope with a relatively low column density. Furthermore, any residual line photons generated in the outflow are subject to repeated electron scattering, which erases line contrast, leaving behind a smooth, high-temperature blackbody spectrum with a steep UV slope. Geometric and orientation effects may contribute as well, since the radiation produced from a disk is likely anisotropic, and the emergent optical depth depends on the viewing angle. Taken together, these considerations suggest that featureless TDEs arise from systems with reprocessing layers that are optically and geometrically thick, yet highly ionized, naturally producing spectra that diverge from those of AGNs while remaining consistent with theoretical expectations for TDE emission. Notably, previously identified featureless TDEs generally exhibit high luminosities \\citep{Hammerstein2023,Yao2023}, consistent with efficient reprocessing of accretion power into a smooth continuum. In contrast, the recent discovery of several low-luminosity featureless TDEs points to a potential role for geometry-dependent effects in the unified model of \\citet{Dai2018}. Detailed modeling will be presented in a subsequent work.\n",
            "It is worth noting that Ansky's optical light curves do not decline smoothly, but rather show clear excess variance, which is a key argument for AGN by \\citet{J1335+0728}. The most prominent excess can be considered as a rebrightening feature (see Figure~\\ref{LCs}), which is actually quite common among optical TDEs~\\citep{Yao2023}. Ansky still exhibits excess variance for the remaining short-timescale fluctuations. However, it is difficult to determine how much of this variability is genuine~\\footnote{One possibility is that the ZTF forced-photometry pipeline is not fully effective in subtracting the contriution of the host nucleus for nearby extended galaxies.}. For example, variations on a daily timescale in the $g$-band are not synchronized with those in the $r$-band. Similar excess variance can be seen in the $r$-band of AT2022gri, while its $g$-band light curve remains relatively smooth. In the near future, it would be interesting to explore the short-timescale (e.g. hourly to daily) optical variability of TDEs with deeper surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST; \\citealt{LSST}) and the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST; \\citealt{WFST}). At this point, we are not considering the excess variance to be a serious issue for the TDE scenario.\n"

The galaxy SDSSJ1335+0728, at a redshift of 0.024, had remained photometrically stable for two decades until 2019 December, when an optical brightening (designated ZTF19acnskyy or \"Ansky\") was detected. Subsequent X-ray monitoring beginning in 2024 February revealed extreme QPE activity characterized by a recurrence period of approximately 4.5 days, the highest fluxes and amplitudes, the longest timescales, and the largest integrated energies observed to date. Given that its optical light curve deviates significantly from that of typical optical TDEs, \\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025} proposed that the QPEs in this system are more likely associated with a turn-on AGN rather than a TDE.

However, as discussed by both \\citet{J1335+0728} and \\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025}, an exotic TDE scenario for Ansky cannot be definitively ruled out.

        "answer": "The unusually long rise time and low luminosity observed in the TDE event Ansky can be explained by the tidal disruption of a post-main-sequence (post-MS) star, rather than a main-sequence (MS) star. The fallback timescale ($t_{\\rm fb}$) of the stellar debris, which governs the rise and fall of the TDE light curve, is significantly longer for post-MS stars due to their larger radii. For a post-MS star with a mass of $1~M_\\odot$ and a radius between $3$ and $10~R_\\odot$, the inferred fallback timescale is $(0.9\\sim5) \\beta^{-3}$ years, where $\\beta$ is the ratio of the tidal radius to the pericenter radius. This range is consistent with the observed timescales for Ansky when $\\beta$ is between 1 and 2.\n\nThe observed rise phase of Ansky, lasting about 350 days, provides further constraints. Calculations show that a full disruption ($\\beta>1$) of a $1~M_\\odot$ MS star cannot produce such a long rise phase. However, for a $1~M_\\odot$ post-MS star disrupted by a $10^{6.42}~M_\\odot$ black hole, the required $\\beta$ values to match the 350-day rise are approximately 0.86 for $R_\\star = 3~R_\\odot$ and 1.56 for $R_\\star = 10~R_\\odot$. This supports the scenario that Ansky involved a post-MS star.\n\nAdditionally, the peak luminosities of post-MS TDEs are expected to be an order of magnitude lower than those of MS TDEs, as the debris falls back over a longer period, spreading the accretion and energy release over time. This is consistent with Ansky's low luminosity compared to typical TDEs. The longer fallback timescale also leads to a less compact or optically thick reprocessing envelope, resulting in a higher ionization state and suppressed line formation in the early phase. Theoretical models further suggest that post-MS TDEs are intrinsically rarer than MS TDEs due to the shorter duration of the post-MS phase and differences in the loss-cone dynamics.\n\nIn summary, the disruption of a post-MS star with appropriate mass, radius, and encounter parameters (notably $\\beta$) by a supermassive black hole provides a natural explanation for both the long rise time and low luminosity of Ansky, and places constraints on the nature of the disrupted star and the dynamics of the encounter.",

The galaxy SDSSJ1335+0728, at a redshift of 0.024, had remained photometrically stable for two decades until 2019 December, when an optical brightening (designated ZTF19acnskyy or \"Ansky\") was detected.

This characteristic is inconsistent with the turn-on AGN scenario as suggested by~\\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025}.

Instead, we propose that Ansky is most likely the tidal disruption of a post-MS star by a typical SMBH.

        "answer": "The association between QPEs and featureless TDEs in ZTF19acnskyy (\"Ansky\") is supported by several lines of evidence. First, Ansky exhibited extreme QPE activity following an optical outburst, with X-ray spectra that are super-soft and well described by a blackbody, typical of TDEs. Its optical and UV spectra are featureless, lacking broad emission lines, which aligns with the subclass of featureless TDEs and is difficult to reconcile with a standard AGN scenario. The blue optical color and soft X-ray emission further support the TDE interpretation.

Although an AGN turn-on cannot be definitively ruled out, the evidence favors a rare, featureless TDE as the origin of Ansky's QPEs. This case provides the first direct link between QPEs and featureless TDEs, supporting a unified scenario where QPEs arise from the interaction between a quasi-circular EMRI and a TDE disk, especially in recently faded AGNs.

            "An optically thick reprocessing layer surrounding the inner accretion flow can efficiently thermalize the ionizing radiation, suppressing line formation and producing the nearly blackbody continua observed \\citep{Roth2020}. The extreme ionization state of the reprocessing gas may further inhibit bound\u2013bound transitions from H and He, preventing the appearance of broad emission features commonly seen in other TDEs. Such an extreme ionization state can be induced by either a very high irradiating luminosity or a reprocessing envelope with a relatively low column density. Furthermore, any residual line photons generated in the outflow are subject to repeated electron scattering, which erases line contrast, leaving behind a smooth, high-temperature blackbody spectrum with a steep UV slope. Geometric and orientation effects may contribute as well, since the radiation produced from a disk is likely anisotropic, and the emergent optical depth depends on the viewing angle. Taken together, these considerations suggest that featureless TDEs arise from systems with reprocessing layers that are optically and geometrically thick, yet highly ionized, naturally producing spectra that diverge from those of AGNs while remaining consistent with theoretical expectations for TDE emission. Notably, previously identified featureless TDEs generally exhibit high luminosities \\citep{Hammerstein2023,Yao2023}, consistent with efficient reprocessing of accretion power into a smooth continuum. In contrast, the recent discovery of several low-luminosity featureless TDEs points to a potential role for geometry-dependent effects in the unified model of \\citet{Dai2018}. Detailed modeling will be presented in a subsequent work.\n",
            "Although there are an increasing number of cases where QPEs are associated with TDEs, it remains unclear whether a TDE is a prerequisite for QPE production. Therefore, ZTF19acnskyy (\"Ansky\") is a particularly noteworthy case, as it represents a potential first QPE source linked to a turn-on AGN. If confirmed, this would suggest a novel yet analogous formation mechanism for QPEs and imply that their occurrence is related to sudden accretion outbursts but not necessarily to TDEs.\n",
            "Therefore, it is the first time that a rare, featureless TDE has been directly linked to QPEs in the case of Ansky. It provides further support for the unified scenario, in which QPEs arise from the collision between a quasi-circular EMRI and a TDE disk, with the occurrence rates of both being significantly boosted in recently faded AGNs~\\citep{Jiang2025}. In this regard, efforts are underway to discover alternative formation channels for QPEs beyond TDEs. Upcoming deeper surveys, such as LSST and WFST, will undoubtedly reveal more faint TDEs similar to Ansky, which will further clarify the nature of featureless TDEs as well as the connection between TDEs and QPEs. On the other hand, future observations of more SMBH accretion outbursts associated with QPEs could help determine whether QPEs are exclusively tied to TDEs. Notably, the existence of Type II QPEs linked to episodic gas accretion in AGNs has been predicted by \\citet{Lyu2025}. Thus, it is encouraging to explore whether turn-on AGNs remain a viable alternative channel, even if not the one observed in Ansky. \n",

However, the recently discovered QPEs in ZTF19acnskyy (\"Ansky\") appear to be linked to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) rather than a TDE, as their slow decay and AGN-like variability differ markedly from that of typical TDEs. This finding may imply broader formation channels for QPEs. To further investigate Ansky\u2019s nature, we obtained a timely ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which reveals a featureless, TDE-like spectrum devoid of broad optical or UV emission lines. Additionally, the steep UV continuum, fitted by a power-law  with an index of -2.6, aligns more closely with TDEs than with AGNs. Compared to other featureless TDEs, Ansky exhibits a significantly lower blackbody luminosity ($\\sim10^{43}~\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$) and much longer rise/decay timescales, suggesting a distinct TDE subclass. An offset TDE involving an intermediate-mass black hole is unlikely, given its position consistent with the galactic center with a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit of 54\\,pc. Instead, we propose that Ansky may result from the tidal disruption of a post-main-sequence star by a typical supermassive black hole.

            "We assumed that the disruption occurs at $t=0$, the TDE begins to shine at $t=P(\\epsilon_{\\rm mb})$ (orbital period of the most bound debris), and the luminosity reaches its peak at $t=P(\\epsilon_{\\rm peak})$ (orbital period of the debris responsible for the peak fallback rate). Then the duration of the rising phase is $\\Delta t = P(\\epsilon_{\\rm peak}) - P(\\epsilon_{\\rm mb})$.

Moreover, as the debris falls back over a longer timescale, the reprocessing envelope formed in the early phase is likely less compact or optically thick compared to those formed in MS TDEs, which naturally leads to a higher ionization state and suppresses line formation.\nTheoretical predictions suggest that the incidence rate of post-MS TDEs is much lower than that of MS TDEs~\\citep{MacLeod2012}, considering comprehensively the differences in the duration of post-MS and MS stages as well as the differences in loss-cones.\n"

The galaxy SDSSJ1335+0728, at a redshift of 0.024, had remained photometrically stable for two decades until 2019 December, when an optical brightening (designated ZTF19acnskyy or \"Ansky\") was detected. Subsequent X-ray monitoring beginning in 2024 February revealed extreme QPE activity characterized by a recurrence period of approximately 4.5 days, the highest fluxes and amplitudes, the longest timescales, and the largest integrated energies observed to date. Given that its optical light curve deviates significantly from that of typical optical TDEs, \\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025} proposed that the QPEs in this system are more likely associated with a turn-on AGN rather than a TDE. This discovery, therefore, potentially broadens the range of plausible formation channels for QPEs. However, as discussed by both \\citet{J1335+0728} and \\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025}, an exotic TDE scenario for Ansky cannot be definitively ruled out. First, its blue optical color and soft X-ray emission (blackbody temperature $kT_{\\rm bb} \\approx 50$\u2013100~eV) are both typical characteristics of TDEs. Moreover, the absence of broad emission lines in the optical spectra of SDSSJ1335+0728 even after the outburst \\citep{J1335+0728} poses a challenge for the AGN interpretation.

This finding may imply broader formation channels for QPEs. To further investigate Ansky\u2019s nature, we obtained a timely ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which reveals a featureless, TDE-like spectrum devoid of broad optical or UV emission lines. Additionally, the steep UV continuum, fitted by a power-law  with an index of -2.6, aligns more closely with TDEs than with AGNs.

        "question": "What evidence supports the classification of Ansky as a featureless tidal disruption event (TDE) rather than an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or a weak-emission-line quasar (WLQ), and how do its properties compare to other known featureless TDEs and nuclear transients?",
        "answer": "Several lines of evidence support the classification of Ansky as a featureless tidal disruption event (TDE) rather than an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or a weak-emission-line quasar (WLQ). First, Ansky's light curve exhibits a very long timescale, with a rise time ($t_{1/2,\\rm rise}$) of nearly 128 days and a decline time ($t_{1/2,\\rm decline}$) of about 1550 days, followed by a slow power-law fading, which is atypical for most AGN outbursts. Multi-wavelength observations reveal the persistent absence of broad emission lines, a defining feature of turn-on AGNs, despite evidence for substantial gas in both the inner accretion disk and at larger scales. This suggests a gas gap at the broad-line region (BLR) scale, which is difficult to reconcile with standard AGN scenarios.\n\nComparisons with WLQs show further inconsistencies: while WLQs lack strong broad emission lines, they typically still display a weak Mg II emission line and normal H\u03b2 lines in the near-infrared, both of which are absent in Ansky. Additionally, the X-ray properties of WLQs (hard power-law spectra) do not match those observed in Ansky.\n\nTime-domain surveys have revealed a class of ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs), some of which, like ASASSN-20hx, share similarities with Ansky, such as featureless optical spectra and slowly evolving, low-luminosity light curves. However, the most natural alignment is with the recently identified population of featureless TDEs, which are characterized by blue continua, lack of discernible emission lines, higher luminosities, longer rise timescales, and more massive black holes compared to canonical TDEs. Ansky, while at the lower end of luminosity and the longer end of the rising timescale, closely resembles other nearby featureless TDEs such as AT2022gri and AT2021ehb in its UV spectrum, which shows an extremely high-temperature blackbody and a steep, featureless continuum. These properties are markedly different from those of AGNs and WLQs. Another example, GSN069, also displays late-stage TDE features without classic AGN emissions, further supporting the distinction.\n\nIn summary, the combination of Ansky's long-duration light curve, absence of broad emission lines, spectral properties inconsistent with AGNs and WLQs, and close resemblance to other featureless TDEs in both photometric and spectroscopic characteristics, strongly supports its classification as a featureless TDE.",

            "All of the multi-wavelength characteristics of Ansky are difficult to reconcile with a turn-on AGN scenario. The most challenging feature to explain is the persistent absence of broad emission lines, which is a defining signature of turn-on AGNs~\\citep{Gezari2017,Yan2019}. It is particularly puzzling that no gas appears to be present at the typical broad-line region (BLR) scale, while substantial gas exists both in the inner accretion disk, as evidenced by the outburst continuum, and at larger scales traced by the strong delayed \\oiii\\ emission (Section~\\ref{spec}). This suggests an apparent gas gap precisely at BLR scales (see a cartoon in Figure~\\ref{cartoon}).\n",
            "It is worth noting that there is a rare subclass of AGNs generally found at high redshifts ($z\\gtrsim1.5$), known as weak-emission-line quasars (WLQs; \\citealt{McDowell1995,Fan1999}), which are characterized by the absence of strong broad emission lines in their optical (rest-frame UV) spectra. However, a weak \\mgii$\\lambda$2799  emission line is commonly detectable in WLQs~\\citep{Paul2022} (see an example in Figure~\\ref{spec_compare}), which is still absent in Ansky. In addition, near-infrared (rest-frame optical) spectroscopy of WLQs reveals that their \\hb\\ lines are not significantly weaker than those of typical quasars~\\citep{chen2024}, in contrast to those of Ansky. Furthermore, \\citet{Ni2018} summarized the X-ray properties of 32 WLQs and found that they typically possess a hard power-law effective photon index ($\\rm \\Gamma_{eff} \\sim 1.2$), as measured from the X-ray stacking spectrum of 14 WLQs. Therefore, WLQs are also highly inconsistent with Ansky in terms of their X-ray and rest-frame UV-to-optical spectral properties.\n",
            "However, the advent of time-domain surveys in recent years has revealed a rich diversity of nuclear transients, the physical mechanisms of which can sometimes be extremely challenging to diagnose. Consequently, some of these events are classified as ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs; e.g. \\citealt{Neustadt2020,Holoien2022}), most of which are outbursts occurring in AGN environments. Among them, we noticed that ASASSN-20hx~\\citep{Hinkle2022} also exhibited featureless optical spectra and low-luminosity, slowly evolving light curves throughout its lifetime, which is strikingly similar to Ansky. The persistence of a hard X-ray spectrum both before and after ASASSN-20hx suggests that it probably occurred in an AGN. Based on this, we speculate that ASASSN-20hx shares the same physical origin as Ansky, both being a featureless TDE (see Section~\\ref{featureless_TDE}), except that it occurred in an AGN.\n",
            "In this subsection, we will show that the unusual properties observed in Ansky align naturally with the characteristics of featureless TDEs. These are a new population of optical TDEs that are featured by their blue continuum, yet lack the discernible emission lines or spectroscopic features present in the canonical TDE classes~\\citep{Hammerstein2023}. Featureless TDEs generally have a higher luminosity, a longer rising time scale, and a more massive black hole than other TDEs~(see Figure~\\ref{LCs_compare}). However, Ansky lies at the lower end of luminosity and at the longer end of the rising timescale~\\footnote{Note that the short timescale of TDEs in~\\citet{Yao2023} may be due to selection bias as they selected TDEs with e-folding rise/decline time of 2--300 days.}. Interestingly, we found that AT2022gri --- the other nearby featureless TDE ---  also exhibits a low luminosity and a long rising timescale that differ markedly from those of other featureless TDEs. \n",
            "We also collected all available archival HST UV spectra of featureless TDEs, which we present in Figure~\\ref{spec_compare}.  Notably, the UV spectrum of Ansky closely resembles those of two nearby featureless TDEs: AT2021ehb \\citep{AT2021ehb} and AT2022gri (ID: 17001, PI: Walter Maksym). All three sources display the hallmark of an extremely high-temperature blackbody spectrum, consistent with values derived from optical photometry, and the characteristic of the featureless TDE population \\citep{Hammerstein2023}. In addition, their steep UV spectra, lacking broad emission lines, are markedly different from those typically observed in AGNs, as shown for comparison in Figure~\\ref{spec_compare}. Another \"X-ray long-lived\" TDE, GSN069, displays emission features indicative of TDEs in a very late stage yet lacks classic AGN emissions~\\citep{Shu2018,Miniutti2019,Sheng2021,Guolo2025}. It shares certain similarities with the UV spectra of featureless TDEs, while all four sources clearly deviate from the typical AGNs.\n"

Given that its optical light curve deviates significantly from that of typical optical TDEs, \\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025} proposed that the QPEs in this system are more likely associated with a turn-on AGN rather than a TDE. This discovery, therefore, potentially broadens the range of plausible formation channels for QPEs. However, as discussed by both \\citet{J1335+0728} and \\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025}, an exotic TDE scenario for Ansky cannot be definitively ruled out. First, its blue optical color and soft X-ray emission (blackbody temperature $kT_{\\rm bb} \\approx 50$\u2013100~eV) are both typical characteristics of TDEs. Moreover, the absence of broad emission lines in the optical spectra of SDSSJ1335+0728 even after the outburst \\citep{J1335+0728} poses a challenge for the AGN interpretation. In contrast, it aligns more naturally with the TDE scenario, particularly considering the existence of a subclass of featureless TDEs \\citep{Hammerstein2023,Yao2025,Anna2025}.\n",
            "An optically thick reprocessing layer surrounding the inner accretion flow can efficiently thermalize the ionizing radiation, suppressing line formation and producing the nearly blackbody continua observed \\citep{Roth2020}. The extreme ionization state of the reprocessing gas may further inhibit bound\u2013bound transitions from H and He, preventing the appearance of broad emission features commonly seen in other TDEs. Such an extreme ionization state can be induced by either a very high irradiating luminosity or a reprocessing envelope with a relatively low column density. Furthermore, any residual line photons generated in the outflow are subject to repeated electron scattering, which erases line contrast, leaving behind a smooth, high-temperature blackbody spectrum with a steep UV slope. Geometric and orientation effects may contribute as well, since the radiation produced from a disk is likely anisotropic, and the emergent optical depth depends on the viewing angle. Taken together, these considerations suggest that featureless TDEs arise from systems with reprocessing layers that are optically and geometrically thick, yet highly ionized, naturally producing spectra that diverge from those of AGNs while remaining consistent with theoretical expectations for TDE emission. Notably, previously identified featureless TDEs generally exhibit high luminosities \\citep{Hammerstein2023,Yao2023}, consistent with efficient reprocessing of accretion power into a smooth continuum. In contrast, the recent discovery of several low-luminosity featureless TDEs points to a potential role for geometry-dependent effects in the unified model of \\citet{Dai2018}. Detailed modeling will be presented in a subsequent work.\n",
            "Therefore, it is the first time that a rare, featureless TDE has been directly linked to QPEs in the case of Ansky. It provides further support for the unified scenario, in which QPEs arise from the collision between a quasi-circular EMRI and a TDE disk, with the occurrence rates of both being significantly boosted in recently faded AGNs~\\citep{Jiang2025}. In this regard, efforts are underway to discover alternative formation channels for QPEs beyond TDEs. Upcoming deeper surveys, such as LSST and WFST, will undoubtedly reveal more faint TDEs similar to Ansky, which will further clarify the nature of featureless TDEs as well as the connection between TDEs and QPEs. On the other hand, future observations of more SMBH accretion outbursts associated with QPEs could help determine whether QPEs are exclusively tied to TDEs.

            "\\begin{abstract}\nX-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are rare and enigmatic phenomena that increasingly show a connection to tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, the recently discovered QPEs in ZTF19acnskyy (\"Ansky\") appear to be linked to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) rather than a TDE, as their slow decay and AGN-like variability differ markedly from that of typical TDEs. This finding may imply broader formation channels for QPEs. To further investigate Ansky\u2019s nature, we obtained a timely ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which reveals a featureless, TDE-like spectrum devoid of broad optical or UV emission lines. Additionally, the steep UV continuum, fitted by a power-law  with an index of -2.6, aligns more closely with TDEs than with AGNs. Compared to other featureless TDEs, Ansky exhibits a significantly lower blackbody luminosity ($\\sim10^{43}~\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$) and much longer rise/decay timescales, suggesting a distinct TDE subclass. An offset TDE involving an intermediate-mass black hole is unlikely, given its position consistent with the galactic center with a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit of 54\\,pc. Instead, we propose that Ansky may result from the tidal disruption of a post-main-sequence star by a typical supermassive black hole. Our findings strengthen the growing evidence for TDE-QPE associations, although other formation channels for QPEs remain plausible and await future observational efforts.\n\\end{abstract}"

            "Besides EELRs, \\citet{Wu2025} have proposed a novel method to identify recently faded AGN systems through the infrared (IR) echoes of a torus remnant. After the AGN activity turned off, the inner part of the torus disappeared first due to frequent collisions between clumps that rapidly dissipated their orbital energy. When only the outer part of the torus is left behind, an IR dust echo naturally follows a TDE~\\citep{Lu2016,Jiang2016,vV2016}, albeit with a long time delay as a result of the large inner radius of the torus. This phenomenon has been firmly observed in AT2019qiz, whose IR echo indicates a torus radius $>1.2$pc. As discussed in \\citet{Wu2025}, the IR echo of Ansky also shows an atypically long time delay, supporting the presence of a torus remnant. \nThe dust covering factor of Ansky is estimated to be 0.06, following ~\\citet{Jiang2021} and using the latest dust luminosity~\\citep{Wu2025}. It should be emphasized that this is only a lower limit, since the IR light curve was still rising until the last IR photometry, after which the WISE satellite retired. TDEs in normal galaxies usually have a dust covering factor of $\\sim0.01$ or less~\\citep{Jiang2021}, so the dust covering factor of Ansky is significantly higher than that of normal TDEs. On the other hand, the residual torus may be collapsing towards the equatorial plane due to the absence of radiation pressure support. Therefore, Ansky's covering factor may represent an intermediate value between AGNs and TDEs.\nMoreover, the delayed yet rapid emergence of the \\oiii\\ emission suggests that the gas is distributed on a parsec scale (see Figure~\\ref{cartoon}), which had remained unionized before the occurrence of Ansky due to the faded AGN. However, on larger scales, a residual extended \\oiii\\ emission region may still be visible. Located at a low redshift of 0.024, Ansky's host galaxy is an ideal target for IFS observation. We optimistically predict that an EELR will be detected once such observations are carried out, which would offer additional strong evidence of a recently faded AGN.  \n",
            "Although there are an increasing number of cases where QPEs are associated with TDEs, it remains unclear whether a TDE is a prerequisite for QPE production. Therefore, ZTF19acnskyy (\"Ansky\") is a particularly noteworthy case, as it represents a potential first QPE source linked to a turn-on AGN. If confirmed, this would suggest a novel yet analogous formation mechanism for QPEs and imply that their occurrence is related to sudden accretion outbursts but not necessarily to TDEs.\n",
            "In this work, we present an HST UV spectrum taken in the late stage of Ansky and analyze the long-term evolution of its light curves. Our findings strongly support the interpretation of Ansky as a featureless TDE, characterized by the persistent absence of broad emission lines in both optical and UV spectra since its discovery. This characteristic is inconsistent with the turn-on AGN scenario as suggested by~\\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025}. Further compelling evidence comes from the slope of the UV continuum, whose spectral index of -2.6 is much steeper than that of normal AGNs but typical of TDEs.\nCompared to other featureless TDEs, Ansky exhibits a lower blackbody luminosity ($\\sim10^{43}\\,\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$) and notably slower rise and decline timescales, indicating a distinct subclass of TDEs. We first considered the possibility of an IMBH origin for Ansky. However, high-resolution HST ACQ imaging constrains the transient location to within 13 pc of the galactic nucleus, strongly disfavoring an offset IMBH-TDE scenario. Instead, we propose that Ansky is most likely the tidal disruption of a post-MS star by a typical SMBH. This scenario naturally explains the longer evolution timescale and lower luminosity, as post-MS TDEs are expected to have longer fallback times and dimmer emission than main-sequence star disruptions (Section~\\ref{post-MS}).\n",

Future IFS observations of its host galaxy SDSSJ1335+0728 will be critical in confirming whether it is indeed a recently faded AGN by detecting EELRs commonly seen in QPE hosts~\\citep{Wevers2024,Xiong2025}. \n",
            "Therefore, it is the first time that a rare, featureless TDE has been directly linked to QPEs in the case of Ansky. It provides further support for the unified scenario, in which QPEs arise from the collision between a quasi-circular EMRI and a TDE disk, with the occurrence rates of both being significantly boosted in recently faded AGNs~\\citep{Jiang2025}.

Additionally, because the debris falls back over a longer period, the peak luminosity is lower than in MS TDEs, which matches Ansky's unusually low luminosity. The more extended fallback also results in a less compact or optically thick reprocessing envelope, leading to higher ionization and suppressed line formation.

            "Among known QPE sources to date, the one discovered by~\\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025} is of particular interest as it may represent the first confirmed case of QPEs arising from the awakening of a dormant SMBH. The galaxy SDSSJ1335+0728, at a redshift of 0.024, had remained photometrically stable for two decades until 2019 December, when an optical brightening (designated ZTF19acnskyy or \"Ansky\") was detected. Subsequent X-ray monitoring beginning in 2024 February revealed extreme QPE activity characterized by a recurrence period of approximately 4.5 days, the highest fluxes and amplitudes, the longest timescales, and the largest integrated energies observed to date. Given that its optical light curve deviates significantly from that of typical optical TDEs, \\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025} proposed that the QPEs in this system are more likely associated with a turn-on AGN rather than a TDE. This discovery, therefore, potentially broadens the range of plausible formation channels for QPEs. However, as discussed by both \\citet{J1335+0728} and \\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025}, an exotic TDE scenario for Ansky cannot be definitively ruled out. First, its blue optical color and soft X-ray emission (blackbody temperature $kT_{\\rm bb} \\approx 50$\u2013100~eV) are both typical characteristics of TDEs. Moreover, the absence of broad emission lines in the optical spectra of SDSSJ1335+0728 even after the outburst \\citep{J1335+0728} poses a challenge for the AGN interpretation. In contrast, it aligns more naturally with the TDE scenario, particularly considering the existence of a subclass of featureless TDEs \\citep{Hammerstein2023,Yao2025,Anna2025}.\n",

        "answer": "The HST UV spectrum of Ansky, obtained six years after the outburst, reveals a featureless continuum best described by a blackbody with a temperature of approximately 38,000 K, with no detectable emission lines. This high-temperature blackbody spectrum is consistent with values derived from optical photometry and is characteristic of the featureless TDE population. When compared to other featureless TDEs such as AT2021ehb and AT2022gri, Ansky's UV spectrum closely resembles theirs, all displaying steep, line-free continua that are markedly different from the emission-line-rich spectra typical of AGNs. Additionally, the absence of broad emission lines in both the UV and optical spectra throughout the observed history of Ansky, as confirmed by multi-epoch observations, further distinguishes it from AGNs and aligns it with the featureless TDE class. These findings suggest that the emission mechanism in Ansky is dominated by thermal blackbody radiation from a hot, optically thick source, likely the accretion disk or reprocessing layer, rather than non-thermal or line-emitting processes seen in AGNs. The persistent lack of broad emission lines over several years implies a fundamental difference in the physical conditions or geometry compared to emission-line TDEs and AGNs, possibly related to the absence of a broad-line region or a different viewing angle.",

Furthermore, Ansky is the first rare, featureless TDE directly linked to quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), providing support for a unified scenario in which QPEs arise from the interaction between a quasi-circular extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) and a TDE disk. The occurrence rates of both TDEs and QPEs are thought to be significantly boosted in recently faded AGNs, as indicated by the presence of a long-delayed infrared echo in Ansky, suggesting a torus remnant from a recently faded AGN.

            "In this work, we present an HST UV spectrum taken in the late stage of Ansky and analyze the long-term evolution of its light curves. Our findings strongly support the interpretation of Ansky as a featureless TDE, characterized by the persistent absence of broad emission lines in both optical and UV spectra since its discovery. This characteristic is inconsistent with the turn-on AGN scenario as suggested by~\\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025}. Further compelling evidence comes from the slope of the UV continuum, whose spectral index of -2.6 is much steeper than that of normal AGNs but typical of TDEs.\nCompared to other featureless TDEs, Ansky exhibits a lower blackbody luminosity ($\\sim10^{43}\\,\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$) and notably slower rise and decline timescales, indicating a distinct subclass of TDEs. We first considered the possibility of an IMBH origin for Ansky. However, high-resolution HST ACQ imaging constrains the transient location to within 13 pc of the galactic nucleus, strongly disfavoring an offset IMBH-TDE scenario. Instead, we propose that Ansky is most likely the tidal disruption of a post-MS star by a typical SMBH. This scenario naturally explains the longer evolution timescale and lower luminosity, as post-MS TDEs are expected to have longer fallback times and dimmer emission than main-sequence star disruptions (Section~\\ref{post-MS}).\n",
            "As noted in our previous work~\\citep{Wu2025}, Ansky shows a long-delayed infrared echo, indicating the presence of a torus remnant likely left behind by a recently faded AGN, similar to that observed in AT2019qiz. Future IFS observations of its host galaxy SDSSJ1335+0728 will be critical in confirming whether it is indeed a recently faded AGN by detecting EELRs commonly seen in QPE hosts~\\citep{Wevers2024,Xiong2025}. \n",
            "Therefore, it is the first time that a rare, featureless TDE has been directly linked to QPEs in the case of Ansky. It provides further support for the unified scenario, in which QPEs arise from the collision between a quasi-circular EMRI and a TDE disk, with the occurrence rates of both being significantly boosted in recently faded AGNs~\\citep{Jiang2025}. In this regard, efforts are underway to discover alternative formation channels for QPEs beyond TDEs. Upcoming deeper surveys, such as LSST and WFST, will undoubtedly reveal more faint TDEs similar to Ansky, which will further clarify the nature of featureless TDEs as well as the connection between TDEs and QPEs. On the other hand, future observations of more SMBH accretion outbursts associated with QPEs could help determine whether QPEs are exclusively tied to TDEs. Notably, the existence of Type II QPEs linked to episodic gas accretion in AGNs has been predicted by \\citet{Lyu2025}. Thus, it is encouraging to explore whether turn-on AGNs remain a viable alternative channel, even if not the one observed in Ansky. \n"

            "Among known QPE sources to date, the one discovered by~\\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025} is of particular interest as it may represent the first confirmed case of QPEs arising from the awakening of a dormant SMBH. The galaxy SDSSJ1335+0728, at a redshift of 0.024, had remained photometrically stable for two decades until 2019 December, when an optical brightening (designated ZTF19acnskyy or \"Ansky\") was detected. Subsequent X-ray monitoring beginning in 2024 February revealed extreme QPE activity characterized by a recurrence period of approximately 4.5 days, the highest fluxes and amplitudes, the longest timescales, and the largest integrated energies observed to date. Given that its optical light curve deviates significantly from that of typical optical TDEs, \\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025} proposed that the QPEs in this system are more likely associated with a turn-on AGN rather than a TDE. This discovery, therefore, potentially broadens the range of plausible formation channels for QPEs. However, as discussed by both \\citet{J1335+0728} and \\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025}, an exotic TDE scenario for Ansky cannot be definitively ruled out. First, its blue optical color and soft X-ray emission (blackbody temperature $kT_{\\rm bb} \\approx 50$\u2013100~eV) are both typical characteristics of TDEs. Moreover, the absence of broad emission lines in the optical spectra of SDSSJ1335+0728 even after the outburst \\citep{J1335+0728} poses a challenge for the AGN interpretation. In contrast, it aligns more naturally with the TDE scenario, particularly considering the existence of a subclass of featureless TDEs \\citep{Hammerstein2023,Yao2025,Anna2025}.\n",

It was reported in the MPA-JHU catalogue with a $\\rm log$\\mbh\\ of $ 6.17\\pm0.51$, derived from the $M$\u2013$\\sigma$ relation of \\citet{M-sigma}.

We used the Python package Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE; \\citealt{CIGALE}) to model the SED of the host galaxy. CIGALE can fit the SED of a galaxy from far-UV to radio and estimate its physical properties through the analysis of likelihood distributions, taking into account the contribution of an AGN component. We assumed a delayed star formation history with an optional exponential burst, adopting the single stellar population models of \\citet{BC03}. Dust attenuation was described by the \\citet{Calzetti2000} law, while dust emission was included following the prescriptions of \\citet{Dale2014}. The contribution from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) was incorporated using the models of \\citet{Stalevski2012,Stalevski2016}. Our best-fit model yields a reduced $\\chi^2$ of 2.0. In our fitting, we employed the CIGALE to predict the fluxes and uncertainties in the {\\it Swift}/UVOT filters using its Bayesian analysis, which were used to subtract the host-galaxy contribution.

This characteristic is inconsistent with the turn-on AGN scenario as suggested by~\\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025}. Further compelling evidence comes from the slope of the UV continuum, whose spectral index of -2.6 is much steeper than that of normal AGNs but typical of TDEs.\nCompared to other featureless TDEs, Ansky exhibits a lower blackbody luminosity ($\\sim10^{43}\\,\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$) and notably slower rise and decline timescales, indicating a distinct subclass of TDEs. We first considered the possibility of an IMBH origin for Ansky. However, high-resolution HST ACQ imaging constrains the transient location to within 13 pc of the galactic nucleus, strongly disfavoring an offset IMBH-TDE scenario. Instead, we propose that Ansky is most likely the tidal disruption of a post-MS star by a typical SMBH. This scenario naturally explains the longer evolution timescale and lower luminosity, as post-MS TDEs are expected to have longer fallback times and dimmer emission than main-sequence star disruptions (Section~\\ref{post-MS}).\n"

            "Besides EELRs, \\citet{Wu2025} have proposed a novel method to identify recently faded AGN systems through the infrared (IR) echoes of a torus remnant. After the AGN activity turned off, the inner part of the torus disappeared first due to frequent collisions between clumps that rapidly dissipated their orbital energy. When only the outer part of the torus is left behind, an IR dust echo naturally follows a TDE~\\citep{Lu2016,Jiang2016,vV2016}, albeit with a long time delay as a result of the large inner radius of the torus. This phenomenon has been firmly observed in AT2019qiz, whose IR echo indicates a torus radius $>1.2$pc. As discussed in \\citet{Wu2025}, the IR echo of Ansky also shows an atypically long time delay, supporting the presence of a torus remnant. \nThe dust covering factor of Ansky is estimated to be 0.06, following ~\\citet{Jiang2021} and using the latest dust luminosity~\\citep{Wu2025}. It should be emphasized that this is only a lower limit, since the IR light curve was still rising until the last IR photometry, after which the WISE satellite retired. TDEs in normal galaxies usually have a dust covering factor of $\\sim0.01$ or less~\\citep{Jiang2021}, so the dust covering factor of Ansky is significantly higher than that of normal TDEs. On the other hand, the residual torus may be collapsing towards the equatorial plane due to the absence of radiation pressure support. Therefore, Ansky's covering factor may represent an intermediate value between AGNs and TDEs.\nMoreover, the delayed yet rapid emergence of the \\oiii\\ emission suggests that the gas is distributed on a parsec scale (see Figure~\\ref{cartoon}), which had remained unionized before the occurrence of Ansky due to the faded AGN. However, on larger scales, a residual extended \\oiii\\ emission region may still be visible. Located at a low redshift of 0.024, Ansky's host galaxy is an ideal target for IFS observation. We optimistically predict that an EELR will be detected once such observations are carried out, which would offer additional strong evidence of a recently faded AGN.  \n"

            "Among known QPE sources to date, the one discovered by~\\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025} is of particular interest as it may represent the first confirmed case of QPEs arising from the awakening of a dormant SMBH. The galaxy SDSSJ1335+0728, at a redshift of 0.024, had remained photometrically stable for two decades until 2019 December, when an optical brightening (designated ZTF19acnskyy or \"Ansky\") was detected. Subsequent X-ray monitoring beginning in 2024 February revealed extreme QPE activity characterized by a recurrence period of approximately 4.5 days, the highest fluxes and amplitudes, the longest timescales, and the largest integrated energies observed to date. Given that its optical light curve deviates significantly from that of typical optical TDEs, \\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025} proposed that the QPEs in this system are more likely associated with a turn-on AGN rather than a TDE. This discovery, therefore, potentially broadens the range of plausible formation channels for QPEs. However, as discussed by both \\citet{J1335+0728} and \\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025}, an exotic TDE scenario for Ansky cannot be definitively ruled out. First, its blue optical color and soft X-ray emission (blackbody temperature $kT_{\\rm bb} \\approx 50$\u2013100~eV) are both typical characteristics of TDEs. Moreover, the absence of broad emission lines in the optical spectra of SDSSJ1335+0728 even after the outburst \\citep{J1335+0728} poses a challenge for the AGN interpretation. In contrast, it aligns more naturally with the TDE scenario, particularly considering the existence of a subclass of featureless TDEs \\citep{Hammerstein2023,Yao2025,Anna2025}.\n",

            "An optically thick reprocessing layer surrounding the inner accretion flow can efficiently thermalize the ionizing radiation, suppressing line formation and producing the nearly blackbody continua observed \\citep{Roth2020}. The extreme ionization state of the reprocessing gas may further inhibit bound\u2013bound transitions from H and He, preventing the appearance of broad emission features commonly seen in other TDEs. Such an extreme ionization state can be induced by either a very high irradiating luminosity or a reprocessing envelope with a relatively low column density. Furthermore, any residual line photons generated in the outflow are subject to repeated electron scattering, which erases line contrast, leaving behind a smooth, high-temperature blackbody spectrum with a steep UV slope. Geometric and orientation effects may contribute as well, since the radiation produced from a disk is likely anisotropic, and the emergent optical depth depends on the viewing angle. Taken together, these considerations suggest that featureless TDEs arise from systems with reprocessing layers that are optically and geometrically thick, yet highly ionized, naturally producing spectra that diverge from those of AGNs while remaining consistent with theoretical expectations for TDE emission. Notably, previously identified featureless TDEs generally exhibit high luminosities \\citep{Hammerstein2023,Yao2023}, consistent with efficient reprocessing of accretion power into a smooth continuum. In contrast, the recent discovery of several low-luminosity featureless TDEs points to a potential role for geometry-dependent effects in the unified model of \\citet{Dai2018}. Detailed modeling will be presented in a subsequent work.\n",
            "Therefore, it is the first time that a rare, featureless TDE has been directly linked to QPEs in the case of Ansky. It provides further support for the unified scenario, in which QPEs arise from the collision between a quasi-circular EMRI and a TDE disk, with the occurrence rates of both being significantly boosted in recently faded AGNs~\\citep{Jiang2025}. In this regard, efforts are underway to discover alternative formation channels for QPEs beyond TDEs. Upcoming deeper surveys, such as LSST and WFST, will undoubtedly reveal more faint TDEs similar to Ansky, which will further clarify the nature of featureless TDEs as well as the connection between TDEs and QPEs. On the other hand, future observations of more SMBH accretion outbursts associated with QPEs could help determine whether QPEs are exclusively tied to TDEs. Notably, the existence of Type II QPEs linked to episodic gas accretion in AGNs has been predicted by \\citet{Lyu2025}. Thus, it is encouraging to explore whether turn-on AGNs remain a viable alternative channel, even if not the one observed in Ansky. \n",
            "\\begin{abstract}\nX-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are rare and enigmatic phenomena that increasingly show a connection to tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, the recently discovered QPEs in ZTF19acnskyy (\"Ansky\") appear to be linked to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) rather than a TDE, as their slow decay and AGN-like variability differ markedly from that of typical TDEs. This finding may imply broader formation channels for QPEs. To further investigate Ansky\u2019s nature, we obtained a timely ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which reveals a featureless, TDE-like spectrum devoid of broad optical or UV emission lines. Additionally, the steep UV continuum, fitted by a power-law  with an index of -2.6, aligns more closely with TDEs than with AGNs.

Instead, we propose that Ansky may result from the tidal disruption of a post-main-sequence star by a typical supermassive black hole.

When only the outer part of the torus is left behind, an IR dust echo naturally follows a TDE~\\citep{Lu2016,Jiang2016,vV2016}, albeit with a long time delay as a result of the large inner radius of the torus. This phenomenon has been firmly observed in AT2019qiz, whose IR echo indicates a torus radius $>1.2$pc. As discussed in \\citet{Wu2025}, the IR echo of Ansky also shows an atypically long time delay, supporting the presence of a torus remnant. \nThe dust covering factor of Ansky is estimated to be 0.06, following ~\\citet{Jiang2021} and using the latest dust luminosity~\\citep{Wu2025}. It should be emphasized that this is only a lower limit, since the IR light curve was still rising until the last IR photometry, after which the WISE satellite retired. TDEs in normal galaxies usually have a dust covering factor of $\\sim0.01$ or less~\\citep{Jiang2021}, so the dust covering factor of Ansky is significantly higher than that of normal TDEs. On the other hand, the residual torus may be collapsing towards the equatorial plane due to the absence of radiation pressure support. Therefore, Ansky's covering factor may represent an intermediate value between AGNs and TDEs.\nMoreover, the delayed yet rapid emergence of the \\oiii\\ emission suggests that the gas is distributed on a parsec scale (see Figure~\\ref{cartoon}), which had remained unionized before the occurrence of Ansky due to the faded AGN. However, on larger scales, a residual extended \\oiii\\ emission region may still be visible. Located at a low redshift of 0.024, Ansky's host galaxy is an ideal target for IFS observation. We optimistically predict that an EELR will be detected once such observations are carried out, which would offer additional strong evidence of a recently faded AGN.  \n",
            "Lastly, we noticed that \\citet{Ansky_xray2025} recently reported an intriguing doubling of the QPE recurrence timescale in their 2025 observations. Furthermore, the 2025 QPEs were found to be four times more energetic and exhibited a more asymmetric flare profile. These new and unexpected phenomena demand a refinement of the EMRI+disk collision model, such as an evolving interaction due to changes in either the EMRI or the disk properties. It would also be interesting to establish whether this phenomenon is specific to Ansky, i.e. occurring after the disruption of a post-MS system, or whether it is common to all QPEs.\n",
            "Although there are an increasing number of cases where QPEs are associated with TDEs, it remains unclear whether a TDE is a prerequisite for QPE production. Therefore, ZTF19acnskyy (\"Ansky\") is a particularly noteworthy case, as it represents a potential first QPE source linked to a turn-on AGN. If confirmed, this would suggest a novel yet analogous formation mechanism for QPEs and imply that their occurrence is related to sudden accretion outbursts but not necessarily to TDEs.\n",
            "In this work, we present an HST UV spectrum taken in the late stage of Ansky and analyze the long-term evolution of its light curves. Our findings strongly support the interpretation of Ansky as a featureless TDE, characterized by the persistent absence of broad emission lines in both optical and UV spectra since its discovery. This characteristic is inconsistent with the turn-on AGN scenario as suggested by~\\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025}. Further compelling evidence comes from the slope of the UV continuum, whose spectral index of -2.6 is much steeper than that of normal AGNs but typical of TDEs.\nCompared to other featureless TDEs, Ansky exhibits a lower blackbody luminosity ($\\sim10^{43}\\,\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$) and notably slower rise and decline timescales, indicating a distinct subclass of TDEs. We first considered the possibility of an IMBH origin for Ansky. However, high-resolution HST ACQ imaging constrains the transient location to within 13 pc of the galactic nucleus, strongly disfavoring an offset IMBH-TDE scenario. Instead, we propose that Ansky is most likely the tidal disruption of a post-MS star by a typical SMBH. This scenario naturally explains the longer evolution timescale and lower luminosity, as post-MS TDEs are expected to have longer fallback times and dimmer emission than main-sequence star disruptions (Section~\\ref{post-MS}).\n",
            "As noted in our previous work~\\citep{Wu2025}, Ansky shows a long-delayed infrared echo, indicating the presence of a torus remnant likely left behind by a recently faded AGN, similar to that observed in AT2019qiz. Future IFS observations of its host galaxy SDSSJ1335+0728 will be critical in confirming whether it is indeed a recently faded AGN by detecting EELRs commonly seen in QPE hosts~\\citep{Wevers2024,Xiong2025}. \n",
            "Therefore, it is the first time that a rare, featureless TDE has been directly linked to QPEs in the case of Ansky. It provides further support for the unified scenario, in which QPEs arise from the collision between a quasi-circular EMRI and a TDE disk, with the occurrence rates of both being significantly boosted in recently faded AGNs~\\citep{Jiang2025}. In this regard, efforts are underway to discover alternative formation channels for QPEs beyond TDEs. Upcoming deeper surveys, such as LSST and WFST, will undoubtedly reveal more faint TDEs similar to Ansky, which will further clarify the nature of featureless TDEs as well as the connection between TDEs and QPEs. On the other hand, future observations of more SMBH accretion outbursts associated with QPEs could help determine whether QPEs are exclusively tied to TDEs. Notably, the existence of Type II QPEs linked to episodic gas accretion in AGNs has been predicted by \\citet{Lyu2025}. Thus, it is encouraging to explore whether turn-on AGNs remain a viable alternative channel, even if not the one observed in Ansky. \n",

            "Among known QPE sources to date, the one discovered by~\\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025} is of particular interest as it may represent the first confirmed case of QPEs arising from the awakening of a dormant SMBH. The galaxy SDSSJ1335+0728, at a redshift of 0.024, had remained photometrically stable for two decades until 2019 December, when an optical brightening (designated ZTF19acnskyy or \"Ansky\") was detected. Subsequent X-ray monitoring beginning in 2024 February revealed extreme QPE activity characterized by a recurrence period of approximately 4.5 days, the highest fluxes and amplitudes, the longest timescales, and the largest integrated energies observed to date. Given that its optical light curve deviates significantly from that of typical optical TDEs, \\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025} proposed that the QPEs in this system are more likely associated with a turn-on AGN rather than a TDE. This discovery, therefore, potentially broadens the range of plausible formation channels for QPEs. However, as discussed by both \\citet{J1335+0728} and \\citet{Hernandez-Garcia2025}, an exotic TDE scenario for Ansky cannot be definitively ruled out. First, its blue optical color and soft X-ray emission (blackbody temperature $kT_{\\rm bb} \\approx 50$\u2013100~eV) are both typical characteristics of TDEs. Moreover, the absence of broad emission lines in the optical spectra of SDSSJ1335+0728 even after the outburst \\citep{J1335+0728} poses a challenge for the AGN interpretation. In contrast, it aligns more naturally with the TDE scenario, particularly considering the existence of a subclass of featureless TDEs \\citep{Hammerstein2023,Yao2025,Anna2025}.\n"
